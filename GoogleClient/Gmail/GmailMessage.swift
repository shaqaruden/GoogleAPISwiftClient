- The requested threadId must be specified on the Message or Draft.Message you supply with your request. 
- The References and In-Reply-To headers must be set in compliance with the RFC 2822 standard. 
- The Subject headers must match.

	/// The internal message creation timestamp (epoch ms), which determines ordering in the inbox. For normal SMTP-received email, this represents the time the message was originally accepted by Google, which is more reliable than the Date header. However, for API-migrated mail, it can be configured by client to be based on the Date header.
